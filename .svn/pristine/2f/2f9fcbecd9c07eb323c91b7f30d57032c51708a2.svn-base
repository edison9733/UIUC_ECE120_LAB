0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here

My name is EDISON LIU YOUN HUAN and my INTL ID is 3250300534, 12 December 2025. The purpose and general function of my program is the addition of 10 16-bit unsigned value which is started from memory of address x3132 from the file numbers.bin 

R0 holds the memory of R3 to load the current value
R3 is to be used as a pointer to point to the location of the numbers in memory that are being analyzed, starting from address x3132
R4 is a counter which is started from the value of 10
R5 is a final sum after 10 values
; Initialize registers

1110 011 000110001 ; LEA R3 <-- x3101 + #49, make it startingfrom address x3132
0101 100 100 1 00000 ; AND R4 <-- R4 AND #0, make R4 is completely zero 
0001 100 100 1 01010 ; ADD R4 <-- R4 + #10, R4 = #10
0101 110 110 1 00000 ; AND R5 <-- R5 AND #0, make R5 = #0

; Loop
;A

0110 000 011 000000 ; LDR R0 <- M[R3 + #0], Use memory of R3 load the current value that one of the ten binary numbers

;B

0000 110 000000001 ;  Branch to (PC + 1) + 1 to ignore if the new number is negative

0001 110 110 0 00 000 ; ADD R5 <- R5 + R0, store the value in R5

; C

0001 011 011 1 00001 ; ADD R3 <- R3 + #1, Increment pointer by adding 1 to become x3133

0001 100 100 1 11111 ; ADD R4 < - R4 + #-1, Decrement counter by xFFFF to become value of 9

; D

0000 001 111111010 ; BR to (PC + 1) + #-6 which is steps 2.a and loop while previous CC is 001

; Stop 

1111 0000 00100101 ; TRAP x25, HALT the program
