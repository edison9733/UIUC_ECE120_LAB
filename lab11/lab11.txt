Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab13.asm. Identify the cause of each error.
    1. LINE 14: illegal operands for missing opcode > assembler does not have instruction sequence to map instruction and data to memory address 
    2. LINE 16: instruction appears before .ORIG > missing .ORIG
    3. LINE 17: constant outside of allowed range > the offset to the label does not fit in the bit field 
    4. LINE 19: illegal operans for ADD > there is an extra  " , "
    5. LINE 30: constant outide of allowed range > the immediate value does not fit in the bit field
    6. LINE 32: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared > the order of p and z is wrong in BR opcode 
    7. LINE 35: constant outise of allowed range > the immediate value does not fit in the bit field 
    8. LINE 43:  no. END directive found > the assembler does not know where the source code ends 



Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
>   x3000: LD R0, ZERO
    x3001: LD R5, ZERO
    x3002: LD R3, INPUT 
    x3003: LD R2, MINUS_ONE 
    x3004: ADD R1, R3, R0 
    x3005: ADD R4, R3, R2 
    x3006: LD R5, ZERO
    x3007: ADD R6, R0, R4 
    x3008: ADD R5, R5, R1 
    x3009: ADD R6, R6, R2 
    x300A: BRp 
    x300B: ADD R1, R0, R5
    x300C: ADD R4, R4, R2 
    x300D: BRp 
    x300E: STI R1, RESULT_PTR
    x300F: TRAP x25 
    x3010: .FILL x0005
    x3011: .FILL x0000 
    x3012: .FILL xFFFF
    x3013: .FILL X30FF


Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
> Using labels makes most sence because the location contains a value that is loaded or stored . The location NUMBER is specifically referenced by the laod instruction. The value stored or loaded in the memoery location explicitly referenced as NUMBER is loaded into the specific registers.
